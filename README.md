# :file_folder: DBMS of a hospital

### :pencil: Database description
"MediCare" is a network of hospitals. Its database is a complex system that manages the relationships between hospitals, doctors, patients, and departments.

The hospitals are located in various areas of the sectors, and each hospital can have multiple specialized departments, such as cardiology, intensive care, orthopedics, gynecology and obstetrics, pediatrics, and neurology.

Doctors can work in one or more hospitals and are assigned to departments based on their specialization. Patients can have multiple admissions to departments. Before each treatment, they are scheduled for consultations where a diagnosis is made. The treatment can be of various types, including surgical interventions, medication treatments, or physiotherapy, depending on the diagnosed condition.

Additionally, patients have a periodically updated medical history that contains information about previous pathologies and contraindications for various medications.

The "MediCare" database facilitates the management of these complex relationships to ensure quality medical care within this network of hospitals.
